                    <p>The idea of this web application is to encourage users to donate for humanitarian purposes through the game LOTO ROTO. The slogan of the game is: "Donate, as you win! Every winning ticket is a donation to the humanitarian fund! Your donation will really change someone's life. "</p>
                    <img src="img/portfolio-details1.jpg" alt="a picture of project details">
                    <p>The game relies on the rules of the LOTO State of Serbia Lottery, with a few changes. Each player has the option of paying at least one combination of 14 numbers, which is chosen on a ticket with 39 numbers. The premium is achieved in the case of the seven affected numbers, while:</p>

                    <p> • second prize - combination with six hits;<br>
                        
                        • third prize - combination with five hits;<br>
                        
                        • with four hits, a ticket is replaced.<br>
                        
                        With 14 combinations, there is more chance for win.<br></p>
                        
                        <p><b>Why is that important?</b></p>
                        
                        <p>Because, apart from the winner, the payout is divided in percentages on behalf of the humanitarian aid fund, while a smaller percentage goes to the organizer (2%), but only in the event of a win. <br>Thus, more tickets -> bigger rewards -> more hits -> more money for charity funds!</p>
                        <p>We can not predict the number of winners with square footage (change of ticket), so that a weekly fund immediately separates the funds that will cover the cost of replacing the ticket, whose price is fixed. The rest of the money is for funding other three awards.<br>

                        • Earnings from seven winning numbers - 60% of the total fund;<br>
                        
                        • Earnings from six winning numbers - 30% of the total fund;<br>
                        
                        • Earnings from five winning numbers - 10% of the total fund;<br>
                        
                        • Four-digit gain is a replacement ticket.<br>
                        
                        Each winner (with seven, six and five hits) divides part of their prize- 20% as a donation for humanitarian purposes, as well as 2% for the organizer of the game. Funds are automatically transferred to a humanitarian fund. The rest of the money is paid to the winner.</p>
